# coding-events-demo-ch15-exercise

This was a step to do in the week 16 exercises. 
1. The purpose of the coding events app is to allow people to look up coding events and add coding events to the database as well. 

2. The app currently allows people to see a list of events, categories, and tags as well as create them. 

3. The Person class would allow users to make an account on the website. They would need input for a username, email address, and password. 
  They would also need to be able to select events and add them to their account.  On the event listing page, there should be an added button that's something like "Add to my events"
 Their account could be a new tab along the top of the page. 
 I think there would be a OneToMany relationship of the Person to Events.
